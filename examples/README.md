# Examples

- [`incr.lus`](./incr/incr.lus) is an example studied in class. The property is inductive.
- [`ic3.lus`](./ic3/ic3.lus) is the first example from Understanding IC3, Bradley, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-31612-8_1. The property is not inductive and needs to be strengthen.
- [`fib.lus](./fib.lus) computes a well-know integers sequence and defines a desired property which is 1-inductive but not 0-inductive (remind that inductive = 0-inductive).
